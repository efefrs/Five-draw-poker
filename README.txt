Hello!

This is my Computer Science 121 PA 7 submission. This assignment was for the introductory C programming course at Washington State University's Pullman campus.

I took this course in 2020 which makes this program 2 years old. 

I have not updated the program since 2020, take this program as a reflection of my programming skills two years ago.

When traversing this program know that option 3 on the menu was completely my idea, it was not part of the project specifications and I got extra credit for doing it.
I made this extra option so I could test all of my other functions. 
At the time I didn't know what test cases were, I could have opted to do that instead had I programmed this today.

Please enjoy the program!
